Focus Group Discussion - Consumer Shopping Preferences Study
Date: January 18, 2025
Moderator: Sarah Johnson
Participants: 8 people, ages 25-45
Location: Online via Zoom

Moderator: Welcome everyone to today's focus group discussion. We're exploring consumer shopping preferences, particularly the shift between online and in-store shopping. Let's start with introductions. Could each of you briefly tell us your name, age, and your primary shopping preference?

Participant 1: Hi, I'm Jessica, 32 years old. I'm definitely an online shopper. With two young kids, I barely have time to go to physical stores anymore. Amazon Prime is basically my best friend.

Participant 2: I'm Michael, 28. I'm actually the opposite of Jessica. I prefer shopping in stores because I like to see and touch products before buying, especially for clothes and electronics. Online shopping feels too risky for expensive items.

Participant 3: Sarah here, 41. I do a mix of both, but it really depends on what I'm buying. Groceries and household items? Online for sure. But for special occasions or gifts, I love the experience of browsing in stores.

Participant 4: Tom, 35. I'm mostly online, but that's because I hate crowds and long lines. The convenience factor is huge for me. Plus, I can easily compare prices across different websites.

Participant 5: Hi everyone, I'm Lisa, 29. I started as an in-store shopper but COVID really changed my habits. Now I'm probably 80% online, 20% in-store. The only thing I miss is trying on clothes.

Participant 6: David, 44. I'm old school - still prefer walking into stores. I like talking to salespeople, getting their recommendations. Online reviews are helpful, but nothing beats human interaction for me.

Participant 7: I'm Amanda, 26. I'm what you'd call a hybrid shopper. I research everything online first, read reviews, compare prices, but then I often go to the store to make the actual purchase. Best of both worlds.

Participant 8: Mark, 38. I'm primarily online, but I've had some bad experiences with returns and exchanges. That's made me more cautious about what I buy online versus in-store.

Moderator: Thank you all for those introductions. I'm hearing some interesting patterns already. Jessica, you mentioned Amazon Prime being your best friend. Can you tell us more about what specifically draws you to online shopping?

Participant 1: It's really about time and convenience. I can shop at 11 PM after the kids are asleep, I don't have to deal with parking, crowds, or long checkout lines. Plus, with Prime, most things arrive in two days or less. It's just so much easier than loading kids into car seats and dealing with their meltdowns in stores.

Moderator: That's a great point about shopping at unconventional hours. Michael, you mentioned preferring to see and touch products. Can you elaborate on that?

Participant 2: Sure. I've been burned too many times by online purchases. The color looks different on my screen, the fabric feels cheap when it arrives, or the size is completely off despite checking the size chart. When I'm in a store, I know exactly what I'm getting. There's no guesswork involved.

Participant 3: I can relate to both perspectives. Sarah, when you mentioned doing a mix, what determines whether you shop online or in-store for a particular item?

Participant 3: Great question, Amanda. For me, it's really about the stakes involved. If it's something routine like laundry detergent or paper towels, I'll just order online because brand doesn't matter much and I know what to expect. But if I'm buying a dress for a special event or a piece of furniture, I want to see it in person. The risk of disappointment is too high for important purchases.

Moderator: That's an interesting framework - thinking about the stakes involved. Tom, you mentioned hating crowds and lines. Has online shopping completely eliminated those pain points for you?

Participant 4: Mostly, yes. But I've discovered new pain points. Like dealing with package theft, or having to be home for deliveries, or the frustration when something doesn't fit and you have to go through the return process. It's a different set of hassles, but overall, I still prefer it to fighting crowds at the mall.

Participant 5: Tom brings up a good point about returns. Lisa, you mentioned COVID changing your habits. Do you think those changes are permanent?

Participant 5: That's something I think about a lot. Some changes definitely feel permanent - like grocery delivery. I don't think I'll ever go back to spending two hours at the grocery store every week. But for other things, like clothes shopping, I'm starting to miss the social aspect and the immediate gratification of walking out with something I love.

Moderator: Lisa raises an interesting point about the social aspect. David, you mentioned liking to talk to salespeople. Can you tell us more about the value of that human interaction?

Participant 6: Absolutely. When I'm buying something technical, like a new camera or laptop, I want to talk to someone who really knows the products. They can point out features I might not have considered, or warn me about compatibility issues. Online reviews are helpful, but they're written by random people. I trust the expertise of someone whose job it is to know these products.

Participant 7: David, that's interesting. I actually do something similar, but I research the salespeople online first. I'll look up the store's experts, read their profiles, sometimes even watch their product videos on YouTube before I go in. It's like I'm vetting them the same way I'd vet a product.

Participant 8: Amanda, that's smart. Mark, you mentioned bad experiences with returns. Can you share what happened?

Participant 8: Oh man, where do I start? I ordered a winter coat online, and when it arrived, it was nothing like the photos. The return process took three weeks, and I had to pay for return shipping. Meanwhile, winter was half over. Another time, I bought a phone case that was supposed to fit my model, but it was completely wrong. The seller argued with me about the return. It's just easier to avoid those headaches by shopping in person when possible.

Moderator: These are all really valuable insights. Let's dig deeper into the decision-making process. When you're considering a purchase, what factors influence whether you choose online or in-store? Jessica, let's start with you.

Participant 1: For me, it's primarily about time and urgency. If I need something quickly, I'll check if it's available for same-day delivery or store pickup. If not, and it's not urgent, I'll just order online. Price is also a factor - I always check if the online price is significantly different from in-store.

Participant 2: Price is huge for me too, but in the opposite way. I've noticed that online prices can be misleading once you factor in shipping, taxes, and potential return costs. Sometimes the in-store price ends up being better when you consider the total cost of ownership.

Moderator: Michael raises an interesting point about total cost of ownership. Has anyone else noticed discrepancies between online and in-store pricing?

Participant 3: Oh yes, definitely. I've started using apps that scan barcodes and show me prices across different retailers. Sometimes the same item can vary by 20-30% between online and in-store, even at the same retailer. It's made me much more price-conscious.

Participant 4: I use those apps too, Sarah. But I've also noticed that online retailers are getting smarter about dynamic pricing. The price I see on Monday might be different on Friday, even for the same product. It's almost like airline pricing now.

Participant 5: That's so true, Tom. I've started screenshotting prices when I'm comparison shopping because they change so frequently. It's made the whole process more complicated, but potentially more rewarding if you time it right.

Moderator: This is fascinating. You're all describing quite sophisticated shopping behaviors. Let's talk about the future. Where do you see your shopping habits heading in the next few years? David, what's your perspective?

Participant 6: I think I'll probably move more online, but reluctantly. The younger salespeople in stores seem to know less and less about the products. They're often just reading from the same websites I could access at home. If the human expertise advantage disappears, then convenience wins.

Participant 7: I think we'll see more hybrid experiences. Like, I love that some stores now let you order online and try things on in-store before committing to the purchase. Or virtual try-on technology that's getting better. The line between online and offline is blurring.

Participant 8: Amanda's right about the blurring lines. I think augmented reality and virtual reality will change everything. If I can virtually "try on" clothes or see how furniture looks in my actual room, that eliminates most of my objections to online shopping.

Moderator: Those are some exciting possibilities. As we wrap up, I'd like each of you to share one thing you wish retailers would improve about your shopping experience, whether online or in-store. Let's go around the room one more time.

Participant 1: Better integration between online and in-store inventory. Nothing's more frustrating than seeing something available online but not being able to find it in the store, or vice versa.

Participant 2: More generous and simpler return policies. If retailers want me to take the risk of buying online, they need to make it easy to fix mistakes.

Participant 3: I want more personalized recommendations based on my actual purchase history, not just what I've browsed. Show me things I'll actually buy and use.

Participant 4: Faster, more reliable delivery options. If you promise two-day delivery, deliver in two days. Don't make me wonder if my package is lost.

Participant 5: Better size consistency across brands and better virtual fitting tools. Sizing is still the biggest barrier to online clothes shopping.

Participant 6: More knowledgeable staff in stores, and better ways to connect with experts when shopping online. Maybe live chat with actual product specialists.

Participant 7: Seamless price matching across all channels. If it's cheaper online, honor that price in-store without making me jump through hoops.

Participant 8: More transparent pricing that includes all fees upfront, and better protection against fake reviews and counterfeit products online.

Moderator: These are all excellent suggestions. Thank you everyone for such a rich discussion. Your insights will be invaluable for understanding how consumer shopping preferences are evolving. This concludes our focus group session.
