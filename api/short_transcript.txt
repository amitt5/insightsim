Focus Group Discussion - Consumer Shopping Preferences Study
Date: January 18, 2025
Moderator: Sarah Johnson
Participants: 8 people, ages 25-45
Location: Online via Zoom

Moderator: Today we're discussing online vs in-store shopping. Let's start with Sarah.

Sarah: I prefer online shopping because it's convenient. I can shop anytime, especially late at night when stores are closed. The only downside is I can't try things on.

Mike: I'm the opposite. I like going to physical stores because I can touch and feel products. For clothes especially, I need to try them on. But I hate the crowds on weekends.

Lisa: I do both depending on what I'm buying. For books and electronics, online is fine. But for groceries, I prefer going to the store to pick fresh produce.

Moderator: What about delivery times?

Sarah: Amazon Prime is great - next day delivery usually. But sometimes packages get stolen from my doorstep.

Mike: That's another reason I prefer stores. I get my stuff immediately, no waiting or worrying about delivery issues.
