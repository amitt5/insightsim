Focus Group Discussion - Consumer Preferences Study
Date: January 18, 2025
Moderator: Sarah Johnson
Participants: 8 people, ages 25-45

Moderator: Welcome everyone. Today we're discussing your shopping preferences. Let's start with online vs in-store shopping. What do you prefer?

Participant 1: I definitely prefer online shopping. It's so much more convenient, especially with kids.

Participant 2: I'm the opposite. I like to see and touch products before buying, especially for clothes.

Participant 3: I do both, but online for routine purchases like groceries, in-store for special items.

Moderator: That's interesting. Can you tell me more about what drives those decisions?

Participant 1: Time is my biggest factor. Online saves me hours every week.

Participant 4: For me, it's about the experience. I enjoy browsing in stores, it's relaxing.
